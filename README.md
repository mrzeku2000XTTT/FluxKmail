🚀 Getting Started
💻 Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mrzeku2000XTTT/FluxKmail.git
cd FluxKmail

📦 Install Dependencies
npm install

🧪 Run Dev Server
npm run dev


This will start a local server (usually on http://localhost:5173) so you can see the app live while developing.

📦 Build for Production
npm run build


Then serve the output (dist/ folder) on any static host (Netlify, Vercel, Base44, etc.).

🛡 Linting

To check your code style with ESLint:

npm run lint
